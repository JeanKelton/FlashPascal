# FlashPascal

I had a lot of fun developping FlashPascal (a Pascal compiler for Flash), but now Flash is dead, and I haven't made any change on that project since years.

So I release the full source code of FlashPascal under GPL :)

the application was designed with Delphi 6 ! so do not expect to build this application with a "unicode" Delphi version (2009 or more).

If you have Delphi 6 or 7 (maybe 5), you can build the application from the command line with Build.bat by adjusting the Delphi "bin" path (C:\Borland\Delphi6\Bin by default)

there's already a website about FlashPascal so you can [visit it](http://flashpascal.execute.fr) for more informations.

My new compiler project is [APKPascal](https://github.com/tothpaul/APKPascal), a Pascal compiler for Dalvik, the Android byte-code !
